# Blazor-University-App
This app was created on dot net 7 framework using Syncfusion Blazor on platforms such as Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

This fullstack application uses a University's relational database built by me on  Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and working application built on Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.
The architecture for this application used is MVC Architecture which stands for Model-View-Controller, where data models store model classes for the entities used in my University database and Views/Pages were created for each model representing and fetching data from the database.
The application was tested on LocalHost server and all the necessary frontend-backend connections were satisfied.

The Pages use Syncfusion Datagrid template to represent the data from the database and perform further CRUD operations from the front end.
